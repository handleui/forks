description: Parallel AI coding agents with Git-native orchestration
---

Forks is a local-first control UI for orchestrating AI coding agents. Run multiple agents in parallel, each working on isolated Git branches, and choose which results to keep.

## What is Forks?

Forks gives you a Codex-native interface for AI-assisted software engineering. Instead of a single chat thread where you wait for one response at a time, Forks lets you spawn parallel agents—each working in its own Git worktree—and merge the results you want.

## Core Mental Model

Forks organizes work into a clear hierarchy:

```
Workspace → Thread → Fork → Task
```

- **Workspace**: A local repository where you do development
- **Thread**: A unit of work or problem you're solving
- **Fork**: A parallel attempt at solving that problem (each in its own Git branch)
- **Task**: An individual action an agent takes within a fork

When you ask Forks to help with something, you create a thread. From that thread, you can spawn multiple forks—each one exploring a different approach. Each fork runs its own agent that creates tasks (code edits, file operations, commands) to accomplish the goal. You review the results and merge the fork you prefer.

## Key Principles

**Git as the source of truth.** Every fork is a real Git branch. No hidden state, no magic. If you look at your repo with `git branch -a`, you'll see your forks. This means standard Git tools work: you can cherry-pick, rebase, or manually edit any fork.

**Parallel attempts, explicit choice.** AI is non-deterministic. The same prompt can produce different solutions. Forks embraces this by making it easy to try multiple approaches simultaneously and pick the best one.

**MCP backbone.** Forks uses the Model Context Protocol to communicate between its components. The daemon (`forksd`) exposes MCP tools that agents use to interact with your codebase.

**Local-first, privacy-preserving.** Your code stays on your machine. Forks runs a local daemon that manages workspaces, forks, and agent communication. No code is sent to external servers (beyond what your configured AI provider requires).

## What Forks Is Not

- **Not an IDE.** Forks doesn't replace VS Code or your editor. It's a control plane for AI agents.
- **Not a chat playground.** While you interact through natural language, Forks is structured around work units (threads, forks, tasks), not freeform conversation.
- **Not a hidden agent swarm.** Every fork and task is visible. You see exactly what the AI is doing and decide what to keep.

## Architecture

Forks consists of three main components:

1. **Desktop App**: The UI where you manage workspaces, threads, and forks
2. **forksd**: A local daemon that handles Git operations, agent execution, and MCP communication
3. **Agents**: AI models (configured via your preferred provider) that execute tasks within forks
