description: Run CI locally and fix errors with AI
---

Detent is an AI-powered CI tool that helps you catch and fix errors before pushing to remote. Run your CI pipelines locally, get instant feedback, and let AI automatically heal failing checks.

## What is Detent?

Detent bridges the gap between local development and CI/CD pipelines. Instead of waiting for remote CI to fail, Detent runs your workflows locally and uses AI to fix issues automatically.

## How It Works

1. **Parse** - Detent reads your CI configuration (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)
2. **Check** - Runs workflows locally against your changed files
3. **Heal** - AI analyzes failures and applies fixes automatically
4. **Verify** - Re-runs checks to confirm the fix worked
