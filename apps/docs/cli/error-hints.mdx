title: Error Hints
description: How Detent provides context-aware guidance to the AI
---

When healing errors, Detent enriches the AI prompt with hints - actionable guidance based on known error patterns. This helps Claude fix issues faster and more accurately.

## How It Works

Detent maintains an internal database of common error patterns and their fixes. When an error is encountered:

1. The error is matched against known patterns by **source** (TypeScript, Go, etc.) and **rule ID**
2. Matching hints are injected into the AI prompt
3. Claude uses these hints as guidance while investigating the actual code

```
Error: TS2322 Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'
  HINTS: Type mismatch. Check type assertion, generic parameter, or use compatible type.
```

## Supported Sources

Detent includes hints for common errors across multiple languages and tools:

| Source | Coverage |
|--------|----------|
| TypeScript | Type errors (TS2322, TS2339, TS2345, etc.) |
| Biome | Lint rules (noVar, useConst, noUnusedVariables) |
| Go | Compiler errors, unused variables/imports |
| Go Test | Test failures, assertions, panics, timeouts |
| Vitest | Assertion failures, null access |
| Rust | Scope errors, type mismatches |
| Python | NameError, TypeError, ImportError |
| ESLint | Common lint rules |
| Docker | Build failures, missing files, platform issues |
| Node.js | Module resolution, syntax errors |
| Infrastructure | Timeouts, connection issues, permissions |

## Example Hints

<Accordion title="TypeScript">
| Rule | Hint |
|------|------|
| TS2322 | Type mismatch. Check type assertion, generic parameter, or use compatible type. |
| TS2339 | Property doesn't exist on type. Check spelling, add to interface, or use optional chaining. |
| TS2532 | Object possibly undefined. Add null check, optional chaining (?.), or non-null assertion (!). |
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Go">
| Pattern | Hint |
|---------|------|
| `undefined: X` | Undefined identifier. Check imports, spelling, or if exported (capitalized). |
| `declared but not used` | Unused variable. Remove or use blank identifier (_). |
| `imported and not used` | Unused import. Remove or use blank import. |
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Biome">
| Rule | Hint |
|------|------|
| lint/style/noVar | Replace 'var' with 'const' or 'let'. |
| lint/style/useConst | Variable is never reassigned. Use 'const' instead of 'let'. |
| lint/correctness/noUnusedVariables | Remove unused variable or prefix with underscore. |
</Accordion>

## Roadmap

Hints are the first phase of Detent's error knowledge system:

- **Now**: Static hints matched by error patterns
- **Coming**: Outcome tracking to learn which fixes work
- **Future**: Cached fixes for instant repairs of known errors
