## Hierarchy Overview

Forks organizes work into a four-level hierarchy:

```
Workspace → Thread → Fork → Task
```

Each level represents a different scope of work, from your entire project down to individual agent actions.

## Workspaces

A workspace is a local Git repository that Forks manages.

## Threads

A thread represents a unit of work—a problem you're trying to solve or a feature you're building.

## Forks

A fork is a parallel attempt at completing a thread. Each fork runs in its own Git worktree.

## Tasks

A task is an individual action taken by an agent within a fork.
